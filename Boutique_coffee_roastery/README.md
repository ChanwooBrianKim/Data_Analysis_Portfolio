# Data_Analysis-Boutique coffee roastery business concern

## Overview
Your business is a boutique coffee roastery, and you sell a range of products to cafes and restaurants around Brisbane City. In order to plan how to grow your business, you have decided to analyse your last year of sales data. You would like to know what the sales data tells you about (a) the areas you sell to, (b) the products you are selling, and (c) what you should consider changing to grow your business.

## Steps Taken
1. **Question**: Questions made prior to business concern that I had to solve via data analysis
2. **Data Loading**: Data is loaded from local CSV file (`coffee_sales.csv`) and Guadian API data sets into the workplace. Clean and prepare the data for the analysis and check each data types
3. **Data Anlaysis**: Import each libraies and create tables or reorganise data based on the raw database.
4. **Visualisation** Visualise data as a result and report is made

## Conclusions
With the Guardian API, we could load data regaridng coffee industry. Based on the analysis above, we could find that people finds coffee more in hot weather and they willing to ignore price of coffee during that time. And also, we could find that avocado has a great effect when drinking coffee. Thus, it would be helpful to sell this product together at all stores in Brisbane to promote revenue next year.
